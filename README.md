This little script extracts the current water level of the lake constance from the external website http://pegelonline.wsv.de and displays the information in a more convenient way.

The script generates a SVG picture which displays the current water level like a fuel gauge of a car.

Preview: (2011-05-10) -- Run the script on your machine in order to get the current water level. :-)
