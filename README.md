This little script extracts the current water level of the lake constance from the external website http://www.pegelonline.wsv.de/gast/stammdaten?pegelnr=0906 and displays the information in a more convenient way.

The script generates a SVG picture which displays the current water level like a fuel gauge of a car.

Preview: (2011-05-11) -- Run the script on your machine in order to get the current water level. :-)

If you are using a rotten browser, you won't be able to see the preview image. This script has been tested with Firefox 4, Chromium 11 and Opera 11.1.
